Sensior Returns 0 as an error code.
This can happen if:

1) A new command is received while it is waiting for the photocell flash.
	Blocking read should handle this?

2) The new luminance value measured is not higher than the threshold.
	e.g. The screen did not flash in time.

3) It is waiting for the photocell to detect the flash for more than 2 seconds.
